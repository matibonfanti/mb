        <h2>different kinds of businesses</h2>
       <p>
Some businesses that seem so essential for the functioning of society are terrible at making money. why is this? take the airlines. last year they transported about 4.5 billion passengers, in flying metal tubes, 10km up the sky, at almost-sonic speeds. it was one of the best years ever for airlines: they made around $6 dollars per passenger. the cumulative profits of all airlines from 2006 to 2024 is $60 billion. that’s 0.04% of $1.5 quadrillion of cumulative GDP. the cumulative number of passengers since 2006 is 50 billion. that equates to just above $1 of profit per passenger. this is astonishing to me.
</p>

<p>
The takeaway is that profitability is a function of value capture relative to its costs and competition, not providing a necessity. a business must focus on providing a differential service – building something new adds much more value per unit effort than refining something established. the market rewards novelty over need.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the few reasons the US is so successful; its venture capitalists are somewhat less risk averse and willing to make relatively riskier bets. in europe, capital is overallocated to Bunds, underallocated to startups. to a large extent, i think this is cultural.
</p>

<p>
Why is Palantir (ticker: PLTR), making less than $500M in net income, worth more than all but two european technology companies? (as of nov 2024). and why did i still choose to own PLTR over SAP or AMSL?

        <h2>The understated extent of the wealth effect</h2>

<p>
This century, asset appreciation has been extreme. in 2023, a staggering 18% of US households were millionaires, but the number drops to 10% when excluding primary residences. millions of americans became millionaires (accidentally) by having access to cheap credit (shorting the dollar) and buying appreciating real estate. some homeowners don't realize this, but they were making more money sitting in their houses than at their full time jobs.
</p>

<p>
The story in the stock market is even more extreme. the rise in market capitalization has been the greatest wealth creator in history. asset owners have been essentially the only winners since the FED started QE in 2008. the losers: those at the other side of the trade, those who lend currency.
</p>

<p>
Thinking about the current stock of wealth in the world, what percent, would you say, derives from capital appreciation vs earned income? almost all of it is asset inflation. this has massive implications in the real economy. the single largest driver of the economy is not employment, or salaries, or interest rates; its the wealth effect. most of the spent money is not “earned,” but “conjured” into existence.
</p>

<p>
Where does this immense value creation come from? in the casino, what one earns was lost by another. in the stock market, this zero sum logic doesn't apply. wealth is created, not transferred. asset prices represent claims on future cash flows, which depend on productivity and growth. when these improve, value materializes - not from thin air, but from the alignment of scarce resources towards an improved allocation.
</p>

<p>
Still, the nature of compounding interest makes the scale of this process mind boggling.
</p>

<p>
Some maintain that this is all artificial, unsustainable, and propped up by central banks pumping liquidity at each crisis. if you believe this, it raises a difficult practical question. do you bet on the continuation of a system that seems increasingly fragile? or do you hedge against a bust?

        <h2>energy</h2>
        <p>
            <p>
A prosperous future must be energy abundant.
</p>

<p>
Nuclear fission was a missed opportunity, made costly by over regulation, but might make a comeback with SMRs. recent news regarding tech companies investing in SMRs are positive, but development takes time and scale takes even longer. see ticker: SMR, OKLO.
</p>

<p>
Fusion is the holy grail, but not yet feasible.
</p>

<p>
Oil and gas production has made a momentary comeback in the US thanks to fracking, and i think they will continue to be a relevant portion of energy consumption in the first half of the century.
</p>

<p>
Solar is the future. the argument is not ecological, its economic. the cost of producing a solar panel has fallen so dramatically in the past years, a solar panel now costs less than a plastic fence of the same size, and it produces electricity for 30 years in the future.
</p>

<p>
Solar panel installation forecasts keep being shattered. every year, installations are expected to level off and yet actual installations keep increasing exponentially.
</p>

<p>
A single solar panel can now generate about 700 kWh/year. that’s more than the yearly per capita electricity consumption of the bottom billion people worldwide. 10 solar panels suffice for an average swiss’ yearly electricity consumption. the energy transition will occur in the context of a much broader and more important transition: the lifting of billions from energy poverty.
</p>

<p>
The issue then becomes storage. if cost reduction trends continue, it can be argued that installing over capacity and wasting power at midday is efficient as long as power production at other times increases. (its already happening in germany and the netherlands). this generates an arbitrage opportunity, incentivizing the development of better and cheaper storage solutions. batteries are also getting cheaper fast, though behind solar panels.
</p>

<p>
Where is the money in the energy business? solar power manufacturing in china is already ultra-competitive, has thin margins. batteries are slightly more profitable. oil has always been. utilities? distribution? physical arbitrageurs and commodities trading? i’ll never forget when oil prices went negative during 2020.
