        <h2>Interest Rates and Economic Impacts</h2>
        <p>
            Recently, I’ve been diving into the asymmetric impacts of interest rate hikes and cuts in the U.S. and Europe. The differences in private debt structure, corporate finance, and public debt management create unique economic responses. For example, fixed-rate mortgages in the U.S. offer households some insulation from rising rates, unlike the variable-rate mortgages predominant in Europe.

        <h2>Monetary Systems and Inflation</h2>
        <p>
            Topics like the Bretton Woods system and inflationary dynamics have a direct impact on today’s economy. Understanding these foundational systems is key to making sense of global financial trends.
